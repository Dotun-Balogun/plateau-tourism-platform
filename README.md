# Discover Plateau State — Integrated Tourism Multimedia System

A destination discovery platform: browse tourism destinations, view photo/video
galleries, read and leave reviews, build multi-day itineraries, and manage
everything through a role-gated admin area.

## 1. What's working right now

- Public site: homepage, `/destinations` (with category filters), destination
  detail pages with photo/video gallery and reviews, `/categories`, `/about`,
  `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms`
- Auth: sign up, sign in, sign out, email confirmation callback — session
  handled via cookies, refreshed on every request by `src/proxy.ts`
- `/itineraries` — signed-in users can create itineraries (dialog is wired to
  a real Server Action, not a placeholder)
- **Admin area** at `/admin`, gated to `editor`/`admin` roles:
  - `/admin` — overview counts
  - `/admin/destinations` — list, publish/unpublish toggle, delete
  - `/admin/destinations/new` and `/admin/destinations/[id]` — create/edit
    destinations, **upload photos and videos** directly to Supabase Storage
    and attach them to the destination
  - `/admin/categories` — create/delete categories

---

## 1a. Redesign pass — map, gallery, reviews, standalone admin

This pass added the pieces that make it feel like a real tourism site rather
than a CRUD demo:

- **Interactive map** (`/destinations`, toggle between Grid/Map, plus an
  embedded map on every destination page) — built with **Leaflet +
  OpenStreetMap**, not Google Maps, so there's no API key or billing account
  needed. Pins are clustered and color-coded per category automatically.
- **Standalone admin layout** — `/admin` no longer shares the public site's
  header/footer. It has its own sidebar + top bar shell
  (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx`), so it reads like a normal back-office tool.
- **Gallery lightbox** — clicking a destination card or any photo/video opens
  a full-screen viewer (`yet-another-react-lightbox`). This also **fixed the
  video bug**: the old gallery rendered every media item as `<img>`
  regardless of type, so uploaded videos silently failed to display. Videos
  now render properly and play inline in the lightbox.
- **Editable cover image** — on `/admin/destinations/[id]`, click the star
  icon on any uploaded photo to make it the destination's cover. The first
  upload still becomes the cover automatically if none is set, but it's no
  longer locked to that.
- **Visitor reviews** — signed-in users can post a star rating + comment
  directly on a destination page; resubmitting edits their existing review
  instead of erroring (one review per user per destination, enforced at the
  database level).
- **Password show/hide toggle** on login and sign-up.
- **Subtle motion** — card hover lift, staggered grid fade-ins, scroll-reveal
  on homepage sections (via the `motion` package). Loading skeletons on the
  destinations pages, and a styled 404 instead of the framework default.

### Routing structure changed

Public pages now live under a route group, `src/app/(public)/`, which is
just an organizational folder — it does **not** appear in the URL. So
`src/app/(public)/destinations/page.tsx` is still served at `/destinations`.
This is what let `/admin` get its own layout without the public header and
footer leaking in. If you're grepping for a page and don't find it in
`src/app/`, check `src/app/(public)/` first.



## 2. A note on "latest"

Every dependency was checked against the npm registry at scaffold time
(**September 2026**), not from memory. Two exceptions were made on purpose,
because "latest" broke the toolchain rather than improving it:

| Package | Latest available | What's installed | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `typescript` | 7.0.2 | **5.9.3** | TypeScript 7's new native compiler ships no importable compiler API yet, which breaks `typescript-eslint`'s type-aware rules entirely. |
| `eslint` | 10.10.0 | **9.39.5** | ESLint 10's rule-context API change (`context.getFilename` → `context.filename`) crashes `eslint-plugin-react`, pulled in by `eslint-config-next`. |

Run `pnpm outdated` periodically; bump both once upstream catches up.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 20.9**
- **pnpm** — `npm install -g pnpm` if you don't have it
- A **Supabase** project (hosted, or run locally with Docker)

---

## 4. First-time setup

```bash
cd tourism-platform
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in `.env.local` from your Supabase project's **Settings → API Keys**:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

> Older Supabase projects call these "anon" / "service_role" instead of
> "publishable" / "secret" — either naming works, just paste whichever your
> project's API page shows.

**Push the schema and seed data:**

```bash
pnpm dlx supabase login
pnpm dlx supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
pnpm db:push
pnpm dlx supabase db query --file supabase/seed.sql --linked
```

(Local Docker alternative: `pnpm db:start && pnpm db:reset`.)

**Turn off email confirmation while you're testing** (Dashboard →
Authentication → Providers → Email → toggle off "Confirm email"). Supabase's
built-in email sending is heavily rate-limited and often doesn't arrive at
all — this isn't an app bug. Before real launch, turn confirmation back on
and connect a real SMTP provider (Resend, Postmark, SendGrid) under
Authentication → Emails. Also check **Authentication → URL Configuration**
and make sure your real deployed URL is listed, not just `localhost:3000`.

Run it:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

---

## 5. Getting into the admin area

Every new sign-up gets the `tourist` role by default — that's intentional
(RLS locks writes to `editor`/`admin`). To make yourself an admin, run this
in the Supabase Dashboard **SQL Editor** after signing up once through the
app:

```sql
update public.profiles
set role = 'admin'
where id = (select id from auth.users where email = 'you@example.com');
```

Sign out and back in, and you'll see an **Admin** link in the header.

### Uploading photos and video

On any destination's edit page (`/admin/destinations/[id]`), the "Photos &
video" card lets you pick multiple image/video files at once. Each file is:

1. Uploaded directly to the `destination-media` Supabase Storage bucket
   (public bucket, 50MB/file limit — matches `supabase/config.toml`)
2. Recorded as a row in `media_assets`, linked to that destination
3. The first uploaded image automatically becomes the destination's cover
   photo if one isn't set yet

Accepted types: any `image/*` or `video/*` MIME type (so JPG, PNG, WEBP,
MP4, MOV, etc. all work). Deleting a media item removes both the storage
object and the database row.

### Data model

- **profiles** — extends `auth.users`; `role` is `tourist` / `editor` / `admin`
- **categories**, **destinations**, **media_assets**, **reviews** (rating
  rollup trigger keeps `avg_rating`/`review_count` in sync), **itineraries** +
  **itinerary_items**, **favorites**
- RLS on every table: public reads published destinations/categories/reviews;
  only `editor`/`admin` write destinations/media/categories; users manage
  only their own reviews/itineraries/favorites

---

## 7. Two bugs fixed since the first scaffold

1. **Sign-in "lockout" bug** — `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` previously
   called `supabase.auth.getClaims()`, which only works on projects with
   asymmetric JWT signing keys enabled. Most projects don't have that on by
   default, so it threw on every request and broke sessions. Now uses
   `getUser()`, which works everywhere.
2. **"New itinerary" did nothing** — it's now a real dialog backed by a
   Server Action that inserts into `itineraries` and refreshes the list.

## 8. Everyday scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start the dev server |
| `pnpm build` | Production build |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `pnpm db:push` | Push local migrations to your linked hosted project |
| `pnpm db:types` | Regenerate `src/types/database.types.ts` from the live schema |
| `pnpm dlx supabase db query --file supabase/seed.sql --linked` | Load/reload sample data on a hosted project |

---

## 9. Suggested next steps

1. Give itineraries an item-builder UI (add/remove destinations per day, per
   day-column) — the `itinerary_items` table and RLS policies already
   support it; there's just no UI on top yet.
2. Wire the `/contact` form to a Server Action (insert into a `messages`
   table, or send an email via Resend).
3. If you outgrow Leaflet/OpenStreetMap (e.g. want Street View, richer
   place data), swapping to Google Maps means: create a Google Cloud API key
   with billing enabled, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` to
   `.env.example`, and swap `src/components/map/destinations-map.tsx` for a
   `@vis.gl/react-google-maps`-based version. The rest of the app (data
   fetching, category colors) doesn't need to change.
4. Add moderation to reviews (e.g. an `is_flagged` column + admin review
   queue) if you expect public, unmoderated submissions at scale.

---

## 10. Deployment

**Vercel** (zero-config for Next.js) + your hosted **Supabase** project is
the simplest pairing. Set the three env vars from §4 in your Vercel project
settings, then push `main`. Don't forget the admin role SQL from §5 and the
email-confirmation settings — those live in Supabase, not in this repo.
